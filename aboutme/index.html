        Hello and thank you for reading my introduction! I'm working on a degree in Software Engineering. I hope to work as a back-end software engineer for a local credit union. 
    </p>
    <p>When I'm not busy with school, you can catch me at the club. The Costco club. I've been to about 15 different locations in 5 US States and 2 countries. The photo above is from my recent trip to the Costco in Neihu Taiwan.</p>
    <p>This course will hopefully improve my frontend skills! UI/UX that's pleasing to the eye is just not something I'm naturally good at. If you've ever been to Bjarne Stroustrup's homepage, that's what I think all websites should look like.</p>
    <p>One thing you should know about me is that I hate the excess of touchscreens. Why does my refrigerator need a touchscreen? Why does my car need a touchscreen? Please just give me physical buttons and switches! If you go on to work for a hardware/appliance company, please pass this on on my behalf.</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading my intro. I look forward to learning with you all this semester!</p>
